## Readme for 2023 version

Some modification and restructuring were done from the previous codes in 2020, which is self-explanatory.
The updates will be made from time to time.

For 2023, I'm using Python 3.10.6 and MATLAB R2022b

Before you start, on cmd, don't forget to install pypiwin32 and matlabengine for python
> python -m pip install pypiwin32

> python -m pip install matlabengine

Cheers, Faisal

## Readme for 2020 version

7 January 2020 - Begin writing this readme.txt

7 February 2023 - Added MATLAB requirements and Extras

### Matlab Requirements
- Deep Learning Toolbox
- Image Processing Toolbox

### Extras (if you are running GTA V)
- in the 'extras' folder, find the commandline.txt file and place it within the root of GTA V installation e.g. D:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Grand Theft Auto V\
- commandline.txt shall resize GTA V to 800 600 resolution

### Installation notes

1. Install the supported Python for Matlab. As of typing, the supported Python version for the use within Matlab is 3.7

Read: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-370/
At the bottom of the text, the download is: https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.7.0/python-3.7.0-amd64.exe

- Install to C Drive. In the installation GUI of python will typically set to C:\Python37

2. Go to Install MATLAB Engine API for Python: https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_external/install-the-matlab-engine-for-python.html
Observe the command below, my matlabroot is: D:\Program Files\MATLAB\R2019b

At a Windows operating system prompt â€”
cd "matlabroot\extern\engines\python"
python setup.py install

a) click the start button, type cmd, hit Enter
b) since my installation of MATLAB was at D:\ drive, so I type D: in the cmd
c) type cd "D:\Program Files\MATLAB\R2019b\extern\engines\python"
d) type python setup.py install
e) if all good, you'll see text similar like below in the cmd after long set of installation status text
...
running install_egg_info
Writing C:\Python37\Lib\site-packages\matlabengineforpython-R2019b-py3.7.egg-info

3. Start MATLAB, or restart MATLAB
4. Type pyenv in MATLAB Command Window
All are successful, you'll get this output:

>> pyenv

ans = 

  PythonEnvironment with properties:

          Version: "3.7"
       Executable: "C:\Python37\python.EXE"
          Library: "C:\Python37\python37.dll"
             Home: "C:\Python37"
           Status: NotLoaded
    ExecutionMode: InProcess

5. For keyboard press recording, we'll need win32api
if you have updated pip, skip this section. Or if  you are confused, run this section :-)
a) click the start button, type cmd, hit Enter
b) type C:\
c) Download get-pip.py to C:\ drive (https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py)
d) Run the following command: python get-pip.py
e) now pip is installed. 
f) refer here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21343774/importerror-no-module-named-win32api
in cmd, type pip install pywin32
You'll message like this:
Installing collected packages: pywin32
Successfully installed pywin32-227
g) in cmd, type cd c:\Python37\Scripts
f) in cmd, type python pywin32_postinstall.py -install
if succesful, you'll get: The pywin32 extensions were successfully installed.


6. Restart your computer.

## Readme for 2018 version
Code for training and running a CNN to drive a car in GTA5 using MATLAB

The idea came from Sentdex (https://github.com/Sentdex/pygta5) from his implementation in Python.

The code consists of 6 main files:

1 - Training_data.m - This file records the keyboard buttons being pressed and saves a screenshot of the game to a file location to create training data. The file it saves it to depends on the button pressed. ie if W is pressed, it saves the image into a file for forward direction.

2 - Key_read.py - This python script reads any keys that are currently being pressed on the keyboard. The MATLAB API for python must be installed to used Python functions within MATLAB: https://uk.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab-engine-for-python.html

3 - Shuffle_resize_training_data.m - This script randomises the stored images, and deletes excess ones, providing a data set of randomized images of the three categories for driving (forward, left, right).

4 - Train_classifier.m - Trains a CNN for the three image categories using the AlexNet layer structure.

5 - GTA5_control.m - This script drives the car. It grabs a screenshot of GTA5, classifies it with the CNN trained in Train_classifier.m and then presses the corresponding key to drive the car.

6 - Key_press.py - Python script to simulated pressed keyboard keys (taken from  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14489013/simulate-python-keypresses-for-controlling-a-game)
